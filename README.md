# rabbit-flare

Rabbit flare is an exciting platform game that is based on the concept of an endless game. The character is a bunny that jumps onto platforms as it searches for carrots to feed. As the player controls the bunny, and feeds it on the carrots, he/she garners more points on the score. If in any case the bunny jumps off and fails to land on any platform, it falls to its doom, and that's Game Over!
